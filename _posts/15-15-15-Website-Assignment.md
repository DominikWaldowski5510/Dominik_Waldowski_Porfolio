<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Assignment brief: College tasked me with creating new website for college to welcome in new students. Create website using html,css and php with working login system for administrator, students and teachers. The website has to display images and have feature to upload them.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
3 weeks
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
I started building the website by creating the layout in html and css I made sure the website scales well on different resolution sizes and is mobile friendly.
<br></br>
Once I had basic layout done I started adding visuals such as images as well as colours using css. I kept colour scheme that matches colleges logo.
<br></br>
Once the website had proper visual design I added javascript features as well as some extra such as map finder and search bar.
<br></br>
Once I finished with all client side elements it was time to do some php for server side elements such as cpanel. This was my first encounter with php so it took me great deal of time to get this to work. I had slight issue connecting to server but that was resolved eventually.
