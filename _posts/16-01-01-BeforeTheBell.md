<p>Before the bell was the first Unity game I ever did in Unity Engine. It was during my first year of University.
The task was to create a frogger like game. The game could have been a complete replica of frogger series but I decided to give it
a little twist by making it relatable with addition of some dark humour.
The gameplay can be seen at:

The biggest problems encountered with this game was lack of familiarity with the engine.
