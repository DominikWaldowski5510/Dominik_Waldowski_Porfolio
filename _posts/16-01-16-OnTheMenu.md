<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
On The Menu
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2016, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
The game was created In summer holidays after first year of University. The aim of this game was to try collaborating with an artist as well as see how much I learned about programming and Unity Engine by creating short simple arcade like game.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
Approx. 1 week
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The process of creating this game started off on a way to bus stop while talking to Kat B. who was the 2D artist for this project. We discussed possibility of creating arcade like game.<br></br>
We came up with concept of having a spider catch prey and then collect it like power ups. To keep the game challenging player would have limited amount of web shots. <br></br>
The game was constructed from knowledge of previous games created during first year of University but quality of code was much cleaner and efficient than other games when looking back at what was done this academic year.
The game had slight issues of detecting collision which was later fixed.
