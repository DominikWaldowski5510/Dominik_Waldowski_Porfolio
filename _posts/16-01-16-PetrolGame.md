<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Petrol Station Game
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Produce console based game where cars fuel their vehicles at petrol station. Consider different types of fuel like diesel and petrol with different types of cars. This project was part of "Introduction to c#" module at University.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
12 weeks, Semester 1 of year 1
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The process of this game started with learning more about programming in c# the initial 5 weeks were used to practice for c# test as well as doing inclass exercises on how to program with c# in visual studio.
<br></br>
After test it was time to start constructing the game. The exercises provided taught the basics on how to make the game work on bare minimum pass criteria although nothing covered the use of timers (time) in c# which complicated the build of the game.
<br></br>
To conclude the game was very challenging as getting used to University life and learning so many new things at once was not easy at first.
