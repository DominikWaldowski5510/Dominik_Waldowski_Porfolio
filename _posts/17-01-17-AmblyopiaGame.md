<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
This project was part of my summer job, I worked as assistant researcher. My task was to research amblyopia and then design a video game aimed at children that would be capable of testing for amblyopia amongsts children. The goals that needed to be met was ability to store data, make game engaging for children and finally make it test accurate for different levels of amblyopia within the eye.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
2 Months,
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
This job was given to me by Course director few weeks before end of academic year. After signing the contract I was told about my task and was told to research the topic before I met the lead researcher.
<br></br>
During the initial meeting with researcher I was told about the goal of the project as well as all upcoming meetings amongst me and researcher. I was provided with facilities within University to work on this project. This included equipment such as occulus VR and so on.
<br></br>
After designing the game and coming up with several concepts it was decided to use Mobile Vr as the platform for this game. The game was controlled with small bluetooth joystick that can be connected to mobile device. The game consisted of 2 elements collecting incoming objects and matching colours. Both parts played role in determining how bad the amblyopia within the eye was.
<br></br>
The game stored variety of data this data was saved in excel format as well as sent to email as an extra copy. At the end of the 2 months the game was given to lead researcher to test it on live participants.
