<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Enemy In The Dark
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2017, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
This was a game jam game with title/theme: "Enemy within". This was internal University 24 hour game jam
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
24 hours
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The event started with grouping up with friends to work on this game. Originally we had 3 programmers and 3 artists but after topic was introduced there were people without any group so we gained an extra programmer.
<br></br>
We decided on theme as group within first 30minutes of jam. We wanted to create a game where player goes around house stealing goods but if he makes too much noise the owner of the house wakes up chasing player resulting in game over.
<br></br>
The development started with us splitting into tasks and groups 2 programmers worked on the movement and rooms. Me and another programmer worked on UI, inventory system, pick ups and AI. I did most of the code for inventory and AI systems. The artists split into Props, 2D and characters with animation.
<br></br>
The development was really pressing us for time. Making 3D game in 24 hours proved to be a challenge. We lost a lot of time on doing elements that we didnt use like trying to create procedurally generated rooms also we had no experience in using animations within Unity.<br></br>
This taught us about managing time better as we were on very tight schedule. Biggest lesson for future game jams was dont do something you dont know because there is no time to learn it in 24 hours.
