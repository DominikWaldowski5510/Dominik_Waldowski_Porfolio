<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Starwars Models with Animation
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Maya
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Create 3 starwars models and then animate them using maya for a 30 second animation.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
5weeks
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
This assignment span over 12 weeks but initial 7 were based on in class exercises to teach us basics of how to use maya.
After the 7 weeks we were told to spend next few weeks making star wars models from what we learned. The models had to different in shape from one another.
<br></br>
Last part of this was to then take the 3 models and create some form of animation using them. Additional models or special effects could have been added when editing the video.
Biggest struggle with this was animation part and getting lights to work together which can be reflected on the animation.
Nonetheless this is not my strongest suit or a path I wish to continue towards but insight gained from doing this module helped me understand how 3D models work within game engines.
