This particular module was very physics centric half of it included exams and studying physics. The other half taught us how to use mono develop to create a game.

I decided to use gravity for my game I created side scrolling space aggressors like game. The art was done by me in paint so it looks awful.

This was very fresh experience as this is the first time I came in contact with another way of making a game that is not Unity Engine.
