<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The game started by getting into groups. The group only consisted of 4 people total me a programmer and 2 artists. The idea for this game was presented by the artists and we decided to go with the concept. The game was 4 player deathmatch in an arena with 2 player support.<br></br> The game aim was to fight other players and at some point a powerup would spawn which would make the player into larger version of themselves dealing more damage for the duration of the buff. The player with highest score at end wins the game.
<br></br>
Me and the fellow programmer worked by taking individual mechanics that we wanted to do and doing them. Since he was an under classman I let him decide which areas he wanted to do and I did anything he was not keen on doing. I did elements such as AI, powerups, spawn mechanic, end game podiums. We closely worked and added extra code to each other classes later on in the development.
<br></br>
The biggest flaw of the game was not making the attack animation transparent enough at times it was hard to see if player was attacking or not but the game itself was fun to play regardless.
