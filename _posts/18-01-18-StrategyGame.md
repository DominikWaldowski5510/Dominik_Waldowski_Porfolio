<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Strategy Game
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2018, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Aim of the game was to create game that uses some form of artificial intelligence, part of Artificial Intelligence for Games module
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
12 weeks, semester 1 year 3
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
I was tasked to create game that would use some form of artificial intelligence in the game. The first thing that came to my mind was to create something I have not done yet so I decided to go with real time strategy game as Im quite fan of titles such as settlers, age of mythology; empires, northgard etc.
<br></br>
I wanted this game to really look nice even though it was only going to be a grey box I used unity basic shapes to create figures resembling people and added animations for all their interactions.
I wanted villagers to perform tasks automatically such as building then automatically assigning themselves to gathering and so on. This was inspired by how games like northgard and settlers 3 and 4 worked. 
<br></br> I drew all icons using paint and modified transparency with gimp2. Main AI type used for this game was state machines to trigger between different tasks that each agent would perform. 
<br></br> 
The biggest struggle with this game was unity built in navigation mesh as it never worked as intended. But I was quite happy with the finished greybox of the game.
