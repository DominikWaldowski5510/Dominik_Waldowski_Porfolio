<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
This was second genre provided by tutor for this module. The genre was tower defence. My immediete idea for this game to create a open map tower defence where enemies could attack from any direction. At the time I was playing fortnite so I was thinking of some kind of building system for towers where you walk to a location with player character. I wanted player to have active role while letting towers do most of the damage control within the game<br></br>
I was really proud of this game, I think this was my best project I created in year 2.
