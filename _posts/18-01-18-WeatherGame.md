<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Weather Game
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2018, Visual Studio C#, Windows 10
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
The aim was to produce a game using emerging technologies as part of the Emerging Technologies module.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
12 weeks, semester 1 year 3
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The initial development was really slow as first few weeks were used to introduce us to different types of emerging technologies.
<br></br>
My most popular concept was a game where you have AI like jarvis that talks to you and you can talk back to. At first I was thinking of star wars like flying game as I created space ships for one of my modules in maya. But I get really sick playing games that have too much motion so for my own safety I chose not to do it. I choose to ground my character and make it simple tank like moving robot instead.
<br></br>
The aim of the game was to transport robot between few points while keeping robot alive. The dangers would be the constantly changing weather.
<br></br>
The technologies used for this project were custom self built  usb encoder joystick controller with buttons. windows 10 voice recognition features and implementing weather API into the game for live weather data.
