<p>I was tasked with creating an infinite runner as part of my University Module.
For this module a new theme would be picked every 4 weeks and new game greybox was to be made in this time.
First theme was Infinite Runner.</p>

The gameplay can be seen at:

  <p> This game was insipired by a game called "Bump 'n' Jump" for old Nes consoles.</p>
