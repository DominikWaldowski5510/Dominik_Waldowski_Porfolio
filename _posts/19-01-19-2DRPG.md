<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
2D Rpg Game
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2018, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Create, design and publish a game as my final year project. Part of Professional and Entrepreneurial Portfolio module
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
12 weeks, year 3 semester 2
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
I knew before the semester started what I wanted to do for my final piece. Original idea was to start working on it during winter christmas break but I was in car accident so I had to start slightly later into the semester.
<br></br>
My idea was to create an RPG like final fantasy titles but make it 2D purely turn based. I wanted the game to include all common aspects of a RPG like inventory system, turn based combat quests and alike.
<br></br>
The art assets I took from open sources on the internet so I take no credit for that. All the code was produced by me during the duration of the semester for this module the game was published on itch.IO as part of the module requirements.
