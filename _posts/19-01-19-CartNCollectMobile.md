<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Cart N Collect Mobile
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2018, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Create a mobile game that is <b>Hyper Casual</b> as part of Mobile Technology module
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
12 weeks, semester 2 year 3
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
For this module I decided to go back to a game I created in year 1 of University, Cart N collect. I wanted to convert this concept into a mobile game. Originally I wanted to implement tracks and make cart drive around tracks. I created bezier curve and made cart move around it. But after testing optimising the game with this mechanic proved to be too time consuming so the game was scaled down to replicate the original but more mobile friendly<br></br>
The game features all basic features that mobile game might contain such as mobile inputs for swiping, purchasing different cart skins by collecting coins throughout the game. I plan to further develop the game and publish it on android market. The art was done by Kat B.
