<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Discord Bot
<h2><b>Program/language</b></h2>
Visual Studio 2019, Java
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Discord is a free video, voice and text application used commonly for gaming. Discord bots are custom applications that help manage a discord server hosted by individual.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
2-3 weeks.
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The aim of this project was to learn something new so I decided to make an application for a change and use language I am less familiar with which is Java unlike usual c#.
The development at first was rather slow as I had to learn everything on how bots work. Prior to this experience I did not know how async functions work or what they are so it took me some research to learn.
When development started off I realised that aside from new elements this is very similar style of programming to my previous experiences so making new features proved to be simpler task than originally anticipated.
<br></br>
The bot contained following features:
<ul>
	<li>Permanent/timed bans, mutes and kicks</li>
	<li>Log tracker(tracks deleted/modified messages)/li>
	<li>Report system (ability to anonymously report another user to hidden channel)</li>
  <li>Strike system(warning user and keeping track of total warns and reasons, worked with bans/mutes and kicks system</li>
   <li>Mini games custom server currency(database to track currency)</li>
   <li>Dice roll mini game to earn or lose currency</li>
    <li>Welcome messages for new members, bot help tools and random funny messages from bot</li>
	</ul>
