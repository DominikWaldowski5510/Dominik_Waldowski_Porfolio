<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Food Fued is a Master degree group project featuring 7 programmers and 8 artists. I work as one of the programmers in the group. The project is currently ongoing.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
24 weeks (first and second trimester)(ongoing)
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The project started by being given a brief to make a game that is similar to splatoon and bomberman. The group was made of all master students from Games development programming and art side.
The aim is to produce a highly polished product at the end of the academic year. 
This particular game is a console game aimed at children 2 to 4 players.
Within the group I work on UI, Animation and Physics. I also often work with other members to help bring everyone up to track being a jack of all trades for this assignment.

The biggest lesson learned from this project so far is the importance of managing various aspects of team work such as task allocation and general communication in a group.
