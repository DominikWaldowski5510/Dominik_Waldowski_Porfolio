<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Splash Dash
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2019, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Splash Dash is a Master degree group project featuring 7 programmers and 8 artists. Aim of this project was to create game based on a brief which required a game in which the key purpose was to paint area, similar to games like splatoon or bomberman.
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
2 Trimesters of 1 Academic year
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
The project started with receiving brief and getting into grasps with working as a team. Management and communication between Artists and Programmers proved to be a challenging task. The varied experience between some members also made it difficult to plan ahead early on as it was hard to judge what each member would be capable of contributing on weekly basis. The upsides of this were that once team became more established and skills of each individual became apparent, efficiency of the team would increase.

As a programmer on the team I worked as a jack of all trades where I would work on any neccessary areas at given time, bug fixes that other members were unable to solve. However my main focus was UI from start to end of project. Game mechanics from early to mid stages of the development and data handling towards end of the project.

<br></br>
The biggest lesson learned from this project so far is the importance of managing various aspects of team work such as task allocation and general communication in a group.
Biggest regret from this project was  the lack of focus on personal development as a programmer, since this was a group project the emphasis was placed on working on strongest areas rather than experimenting and learning new things.
