<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
Sparky Mobile
<h2><b>Engine/Language</b></h2>
Unity Engine 2018, Visual Studio C#
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
Brains Eden International 48 Hour Game Jam Competition, Create a game within 48 hours theme/topic was chain reaction
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
48 hours spanning across 3 days with mandotary rest(computers locked after midnight)
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
This project was done in group of 5, 3 artists and 2 programmers. The second programmer was same as the one who participated in second game jam as well as 2 of the 3 artists. <br></br>
Coming up with concept for this was really difficult we had many different ideas but we could not settle on final concept. After 2-3 hours we came up with game where player has to throw sticks to create path for little baby flame to reach his mother. The little baby kindle could go out without enough objects on its path or could ignite the entire forest if he burns too much.
<br></br>
The biggest lesson learned from this was the importance of having game designer amongst a team. Our team consisted of pure programmers and artist. Our biggest weakness was our lack of understanding of how to make mechanics fit and how to design levels and gameplay aspects.
