<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
<p>The development started by me setting up project management. I created trello page where I did my research and design.</p>
<p>I also use it to track bugs and goals for future updates.</p>
<p>I created discord server to communicate with external testers(willing participants).</p>
<p>The game was hosted/published on itch.io link: <a href="https://dominikwaldowski.itch.io/arenawars">Arena Wars</a></p>
<p>The process is shown through written and video devlogs which are available in link provided above.</p>
<p>This project is currently in progress.</p>
<br></br>
<p>This project helps me develop and understand wider range of skills I never considered pushing me to learn about areas I have little interest in like shaders, 3D, light and music.
