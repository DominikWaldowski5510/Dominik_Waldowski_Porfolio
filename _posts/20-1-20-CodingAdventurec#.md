<h1><b>About</b></h1>
<h2><b>Title</b></h2>
<p>Coding Adventure c#</p>
<h2><b>Language</b></h2>
<p>C#, Visual Studio</p>
<h2><b> Description/Aim</b></h2>
<p>Series of videos where I show how to program from basics to advanced areas.</p>
<h3>Development Duration</h3>
<p>Not specified, one video takes about 10-20minutes to create and then upload.</p>
<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
<p>I always thought what would be good way to show what I can do, I thought that creating a tutorial like video is good concept to show what I can do and maybe help others who come across this video.</p>
<p>I release video on frequent occasions, each time showcasing something new that was not previously covered..</p>
<p>The great thing about these series is that I learn as I do the videos, by reading and fully understanding what the code means.</p>
<p>There is no end time for this as I plan to continue this for as long as possible or as long as I can find areas I can study about.</p>
<p>The playlist to all videos can be accessed via link provided above..</p>
<br></br>
<p>This project helps me understand the code on more technical side as I have to know how to verbally explain it.
