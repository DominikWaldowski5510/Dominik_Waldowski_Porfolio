<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
<p>After I streamed my first project I decided I should continue and keep learning by picking other game genres I have less experience in doing.</p>
<p>This project unlike previous required me to study in several areas, I found it to be very rewarding experience with a lot of new skills gained as a process/p>
<p>This project will receive a 1.1 Version update where I plan to add some small features as well as ability to play with 2 users.</p>
