<h1><b>Development Log</b></h1>
<p>This project stemed from an idea to further develop my programming skills, I wanted to test myself by live streaming the development without using any references.</p>
<p>I started by outlining some rules for this stream and streamed onwards every day before work monday to friday from 10 to 11, (one hour a day)./p>
<p>Throughout this streaming session I reinforced a lot of my already existing skills as well as picked up some new ones.</p>
<p>I decided to make this project open source for anyone to download via github the links are provided above. I also plan to continue streaming various other games from now on to further improve myself as well as be a reference point for anyone who wishes to make their own projects./p>
