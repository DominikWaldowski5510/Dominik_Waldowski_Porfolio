    <p>My name is Dominik Waldowski. I studied Programming/Programming within Game Engines throughout my Bachelors and Masters degree.</p>
	<p> After graduating I started programming a lot of hobby projects in forms of tutorials I stream 5 days a week monday to friday on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/snake551">Twitch.tv (Click me!)</a>. My streamed projects are uploaded to my github as well as my itch.io which are publically visible.
		All links are best found via Twitch or checking my newest history of projects here: https://dominikwaldowski5510.github.io/Dominik_Waldowski_Porfolio/

<h1 class="post-title">What I do</h1>
<p> I have programmed several small prototype games as part of my University studies. Majority of modules required me to produce a game with time span of 12 weeks.
I participated in several game jams most notably <a href="http://www.brainseden.net/">Brains Eden 2019</a>.</p>
<p>My porfolio can be found at <a href="https://dominikwaldowski5510.github.io/Dominik_Waldowski_Porfolio/">here</a>. Feel free to also check out my learning progress <a href="">here</a>.</p>

<h1 class="post-title">What I do in spare time</h1>
<p> My favorite outdoor activities include archery and swimming. In 2018 I was the club captain of Anglia Ruskin Archery club. I attended various archery competitions throughout my 3 years at University.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading light novels, my favorite genres include medieval fantasy and horror. My passion for medieval period does not only extend to books as I am big fan of medieval weapons and castles and armour.</p>
<p>I picked up programming originally as a hobby but this hobby turned into me pursuing career in this field.</p>
